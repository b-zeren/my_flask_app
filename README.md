# my_flask_app
A web application that I wrote with flask and postgresql. This app allows you to create, update and delete users. At the main screen online users can be seen and after logging in, all registered users can be seen. If an user forgets their password, they can reset it by following the link sent to their email.
To make sure everything runs correctly, check the values at the config variables section on main.py (especially email server and database connection string)
